This release adds in-app instructions describing how to configure and use the app. The instructions are accessible via the "MACsposed" app entry in your app drawer. Once the app is activated in Xposed, the app will automatically be removed from your app drawer to reduce clutter. If you later disable the module or uninstall Xposed, the icon will be readded to your app drawer when you next attempt to interact with the MACsposed quick settings tile. Additionally, a bug which caused the app to crash when not activated in Xposed was fixed.
